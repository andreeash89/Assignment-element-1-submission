I have created a simple game consisting of one player that can jump over obstacles and collect objects for points. The player has 3 lives, as i havent finished the game there isnt an ending to it once you die 3 times but you can restard it by pressing the space bar. The controls are simple, "A" to move left and "D" to move right,"W" to jump and the space bar is also used to jump and restard the game once the lives run out. I made this game with the knowledge i have gained in the past year using some of my own resources and help of my friends.
